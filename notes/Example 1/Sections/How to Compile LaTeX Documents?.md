There are essentially two ways you can compile $\LaTeX$ code: using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) or compiling locally.

Using the first method, you don't need to install anything. You have to spend 2 minutes to register on the platform, and then you can start writing documents in $\LaTeX$ right away. You can also easily collaborate with one other person if you're not using premium. (More than one if you pay for the premium subscription.)

The second method requires more work. However, you get more control. You will probably have faster compilation times, and there won't be a limit on how long your document can compile.

For this workshop, we will be focusing on the first method, because the installation of $\TeX$ locally will differ for different operating systems and will take some time. If you feel like setting up $\LaTeX$ locally, however, you can check out [this guide](https://www.overleaf.com/project).

For now, register on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and follow the next steps.
