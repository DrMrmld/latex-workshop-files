## What is $\TeX$?

[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) is a language that can be used to typeset documents, created by [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) in late 1970s. With this language, you have complete control over your document - both the content and the layout.

Many people erroneously pronounce "$\LaTeX$" as the rubber material latex, but the "X" in both "$\TeX$" and "$\LaTeX$" is not the English letter "x" but the Greek letter chi ($\chi$). This subtle detail and its symbolism are greatly explained in the first chapter of Knuth's book titled "The $\TeX$book":

> English words like ‘technology’ stem from a Greek root beginning with the letters $\tau \epsilon \chi \dots$; and this same Greek word means art as well as technology. Hence the name $\TeX$, which is an uppercase form of $\tau \epsilon \chi$.
> 
> Insiders pronounce the $\chi$ of $\TeX$ as a Greek chi, not as an ‘x’, so that $\TeX$ rhymes with the word blecchhh. It’s the ‘ch’ sound in Scottish words like *loch* or German words like *ach*; it’s a Spanish ‘j’ and a Russian ‘kh’. When you say it correctly to your computer, the terminal may become slightly moist.

> The purpose of this pronunciation exercise is to remind you that $\TeX$ is primarily concerned with high-quality technical manuscripts: Its emphasis is on art and technology, as in the underlying Greek word. If you merely want to produce a passably good document—something acceptable and basically readable but not really beautiful—a simpler system will usually suffice. With $\TeX$ the goal is to produce the *finest* quality; this requires more attention to detail, but you will not find it much harder to go the extra distance, and you’ll be able to take special pride in the finished product.

From this, we can also infer that being able to use $\LaTeX$ doesn't mean you should *always* do that. If you want to jot down quick notes during a lecture, you [can use LaTeX for that](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/), but you might also find it easier and more convenient to just use Microsoft Word or even Notepad. The purpose of learning $\LaTeX$ is not to use it to make every document you will ever need to create, but to have the option of using the system that offers you great control, efficient management of big projects, easy manipulation of mathematical equations, and the finest-quality print (among some other advantages).

## What is $\LaTeX$?

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is an extension ("macro package") of $\TeX$. It contains many predefined commands and environments (we will learn more about them later) that control the layout of the document. This allows one to focus on the content of one's writing, while letting $\LaTeX$ do its job of making the document look neat. Nowadays, practically no one uses plain $\TeX$.

There are also other extensions as [ConTeXt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt) and [AMS-TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS-LaTeX), but $\LaTeX$ is the most popular one.

## What Can I Create with $\LaTeX$?

I can't think of any limitations of what you can create with $\LaTeX$. You can write books, (research) articles, [lab reports](https://github.com/DrMrmld/lab-report-template/), exams, lecture/reading notes, music sheets, etc.

$\LaTeX$ is also a good choice for making a resume or a CV because it lets you have an appealing design while keeping the text in the document readable and accessible for both people and machines.

Great thing is that you don't have to start your document from scratch every time. There is a huge number of templates available for almost anything you will need to write. You can check out [Overleaf's template gallery](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates), for instance. Personally, I liked [this homework template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/a-soft-template-for-homework-solutions/gsbwqcqkyyzt) and [this internship report template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/medtech-int101-slash-102-internship-report-template/nfthzgycqbxn) a lot. You can also build upon these templates and improve/personalize them, but make sure you always check the licenses.
