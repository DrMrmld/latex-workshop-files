$\LaTeX$ has a quite steep learning curve. Some people quit $\LaTeX$ because they found it difficult to figure out how to change the layout of the page, insert an image, customize a table, or do other things they already know how to do in other word editors. The primary purpose of this workshop is to minimize the costs[^1] of learning $\LaTeX$ by reducing the steepness of the learning curve and providing guidelines for figuring out things in $\LaTeX$ in the most effective way.

In this example, you'll gain enough knowledge to be able to write most of your documents in $\LaTeX$ by writing a full (kind of) lab report, step by step, from scratch. We assume no previous experience with $\LaTeX$. However, if you are already familiar with some aspects, we still strongly suggest at least going through all these notes without skipping.

For easier navigation, everything is split into several smaller notes.
