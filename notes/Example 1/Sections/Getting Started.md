To create your first project, open the [projects page](https://www.overleaf.com/project) and press "New Project" at the top left. You will see several options, and from them, choose "Blank Project."

You will have to name your project. You can name it however you like. I like to be descriptive with my project names, so that I can easily find them when needed. I'll name my project `latex-workshop-example-1` and click "Create".

This will open up the project page. If you're using the new layout (which you probably are if you are new to Overleaf), there will be three main windows, top panel, and a sidebar (on the left).

The windows show (from left to right) the file tree & file outline, the currently opened file, and the last compiled output. For now, you can hide the window with the file tree.

On the (left) sidebar, there is a "settings" button at the very bottom. You can click it and tweak some editor or appearance settings if you like, or you can leave the defaults. I like to turn off the autocomplete, because I don't like how Overleaf implements it, and turn on Vim keybindings.

On the top panel, you can open the "View" tab and select if you want to leave the current view, switch to seeing only the text editor, switch to seeing only the PDF output, or having the editor opened up and the PDF output in another tab of your browser. You can choose any option. Though, I would recommend sticking with the default (split view of text editor and the PDF) for now. These layout options are also available through the eponymous button on the right side of the top panel.

There are lots of button on the top part of the text editor window. However, we won't need any of them on this workshop, and I personally never use them.

On the top part of the PDF output window, however, there are some useful controls. All of them are self-explanatory, but of the special importance is the "recompile" button. Changing your code doesn't necessarily lead to updating the PDF output because that's not always efficient. But if you made some changes and want to see the new output, you'll need to press the "recompile" button, or you can also use a shortcut - `Ctrl`+`Enter`.

Finally, we will be starting from scratch in this workshop/tutorial, so you should delete everything in your text editor. Leave absolutely nothing there. If you've done everything right, recompiling (`Ctrl`+`Enter`) should result in the following error:
